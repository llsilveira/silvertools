Miscellaneous tools for JavaEE applications

This library contains miscellaneous pieces of generic software I write on my personal and professional work that can be reused somewhere else. My intention is to publish this under a free software license of some kind, but I have not decided which license I will use yet. If you want to use this in your project, feel free to talk to me anytime.

I am not an experienced developer, but I do study and research a lot. My main goal publishing this is to become a better programmer/developer, so any contribution is welcomed. Feel free to criticise, give tips, raise issues, suggest changes, etc. If you want to contribute with code, please contact me first so I can address the license and copyright issues first.
